<h2 align="center">Failure-Driven JSON Mapping in Swift</h2>

Genome has gone Swift!  If you're looking for the original, ObjC implementation, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/LoganWright/Genome/tree/0.1">here</a>!  If there is enough demand for maintenance, another branch may be created; however, any new developments will likely be done in Swift.

### Why

With great libraries like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo">Argo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper">ObjectMapper</a>, why do we need another? Ultimately, I wanted to build it, and I wanted something a little different.  

The goal of this library is to satisfy the following constraints:

>\- Customizable Initialization

>\- Flexible Error Handling

>\- Failure Driven

>\- Automatic Nested Mapping

>\- Simple To Use

>\- Easy Two-Way Serialization

>\- Transformable Values

>\- Type Safety

>\- Constants (`let`)

>\- Independent of Foundation Framework

### Playground

The <a href="/GenomePlayground.playground">playground</a> provided by this project can be used to test the library.  It also provides more detail into how to use the library.  

### Failure Driven

With the introduction of Swift 2.0, we were given an entirely new error handling system, and a new keyword `try`.  In mapping json to models, there are, unfortunately, many points of failure.  By being very explicit about the failability of these operations, we can be confident that our code will run as expected, and gain clarity into error messages earlier in the process.  This means that we're going to have to write the word `try` quite a bit in the name of safety.

#Initial Setup

If you wish to install the library manually, you'll need to find the source files located in the playground's <a href="/tree/master/GenomePlayground.playground/sources">sources</a>  directory.

It is highly recommended that you install Genome through <a href="https://www.cocoapods.org">cocoapods.</a>  Here is a personal cocoapods reference just in case it may be of use: <a href="https://gist.github.com/LoganWright/5aa9b3deb71e9de628ba">Cocoapods Setup Guide</a>

```
pod 'Genome'
```

### Quick Start

Let's take the following hypothetical JSON

```Swift
[
    "name" : "Rover",
    "nickname" : "RoRo", // Optional Value
    "type" : "dog"
]
```

Here's how we might create the model for this


```Swift
enum PetType : String {
    case Dog = "dog"
    case Cat = "cat"
}

struct Pet {
      var name: String = ""
      var type: PetType!
      var nickname: String?
}
```

Now, let's look at how we might provide a mapping schema for our model.

```Swift
extension Pet : BasicMappable {
    mutating func sequence(map: Map) throws {
        try name <~> map["name"]
        try nickname <~> map["nickname"]
        try type <~> map["type"]
            .transformFromJson {
                return PetType(rawValue: $0)
            }
            .transformToJson {
                return $0.rawValue
            }
    }
}
```

There's a lot to look at in this, here's some of the key points:

### `sequence(map: Map) throws`

Mappable objects must implement this method.  This is how the objects can be mapped.  It is marked `mutating` because it will modify values.

`Note, if you're only mapping to JSON, nothing will be mutated.`

### `<~>`

This is the main operation used in this library.  The `~` symbolizes a connection, and the `<` and `>` respectively symbol a flow of value.  When declared as `<~>` it symbolizes that mapping can flow both ways.

You could also use the following:

| Operator | Directions | Example | Mutates |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|`<~>`| To and From Json | `try name <~> map["name"]` | ‚úì |
|`~>`| To Json Only | `try clientId ~> map["client_id"]` | ùòÖ |
|`<~`| From Json Only | `try updatedAt <~ map["updated_at"]` | ‚úì |

### `transform`

Genome provides various options for transforming values.  These are type-safe and will be checked by the compiler.

>Note: At the moment, transforms require absolute optionality conformance in some situations. ie, Optionals get Optionals, ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptionals get ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptionals, etc.

#### `transformFromJson`

Use this if you need to transform the json input to accomodate your type.  In our example above, we need to convert the raw json to our associated enum.  This can also be appended to mappings for the `<~` operator.

#### `transformToJson`

Use this if you need to transform the given value to something more suitable for JSON.  This can also be appended to mappings for the `~>` operator.

### `try`

Why is the `try` keyword on every line!  Every mapping operation is failable if not properly specified.  It's better to deal with these possibilities, head first.  

For example, if a value is non-optional, and there's no associated value in the json, the operation should throw an error that can be easily caught.

### `BasicMappable`

In order to support flexible customization, Genome provides various mapping options for protocols.  Your object can conform to any of the following.  Although each of these initializers is marked with `throws`, it is not necessary for your initializer to `throw` if it is guaranteed to succeed.  In that case, you can omit the `throws` keyword safely.

| Protocol | Required Initializer |
|:---|:---|
| BasicMappable | `init() throws` |
| StandardMappable | `init(map: Map) throws` |
| CustomMappable | `static func newInstance(map: Map) throws -> Self` |

These are all just convenience protocols, and ultimately all derive from `MappableObject`.  If you wish to define your own implementation, all of the other functionality will still apply.

### Instantiation

Now we can easily create an object safely:

```Swift
do {
    let rover = try Pet.mappedInstance(json_rover)
    print(rover)
} catch {
    print(error)
}
```

If all we care about is whether or not we were able to create an object, we can also do the following:

```Swift
let rover = try? Pet.mappedInstance(json_rover)
print(rover) // Rover is type: `Pet?`
```

### `mappedInstance(json: JSON)`

This is the function that should be used to initialize new mapped objects for a given json.
